	\section{Introduction}
	\bigskip
	
	
	
	We’re slowly moving toward the “Knowledge Economy” which is generally considered as an economic system that heavily relies on knowledge for the creation of profit and value (Powell and Snellman, 2004). Understanding how knowledge can be transferred, acquired and absorbed, thus, appears to be of crucial importance for different types of subjects.
	
	There are different streams of research that study and analyze the dynamics of communication and, in particular, of knowledge transfer between subjects or groups (Mitton et al. 2007; Watson and Hewett, 2006).
	
	One important stream of studies that tried discerning the dynamics of knowledge transfer, which can be defined as the moving and incorporation of knowledge (Hansen, 1999), belongs to Social Network Studies. For instance, many researchers in this field tried to understand how specific structural characteristics of a network could favor or impede the acquisition of knowledge by one subject (e.g. Granovetter, 1973; Burt, 1992; Krackhardt 1998; Wang, 2016), the way in which knowledge is transferred within a group (Tasselli and Caimo, 2019), the transfer of knowledge across different groups (Tortoriello et al., 2012), the ability to absorb the knowledge acquired (Tortoriello and Krackhardt 2010; Lissoni, 2001) and to exploit it by replicating it (Chen et al., 2014; Wang et al. 2020).	
	But also the differences between the types of network considered in different studies play a role in the causation of the abovementioned divergences. As a matter of fact, are we considering a “friendship” network (Gibbons, 2004)? Or are we considering an advice network? Additionally, it is pretty complex to define and assess the degree of friendship between two subjects (see Krackhardt 1987; Krackhardt and Brass, 1994) or even the general intensity of the link.
	
	Having this been said, we are of the opinion that the stream of literature that analyses social networks with the aim of understanding how knowledge is transferred, acquired and absorbed throughout the network might be overlooking some additional aspects that are related to the social environment. Even though knowledge transfer has to be seen as a process that is strongly embedded in a socio-cultural context (Giuliani, 2007), the extant literature rarely tackled such aspect.
	
	One interesting aspect that we consider worth studying is the effect that specific structural characteristics can have on the vertical communication and transfer of knowledge and information. By vertical communication and transfer of knowledge we intend the communication and the transfer between one employee and its supervisor (or subordinate) (see Simpson, 1959). There are cases, that can be defined as "Cross Cutting" (Bartels et al. 2010), in which such communication or transfer happens between two subjects that are not directly connected by the chain of command (meaning that between them there is one or more persons between them). 

	In this paper our aim is to provide a tool that might allow to address such type of issue. Better put, this paper aims at developing and discussing information diffusion models that allow to understand how knowledge and information can flow within a company taking into account its social structure. In particular, we found a gap in the research regarding vertical (top-down or bottom-up) transfer of knowledge within a company. Focusing on such a specific knowledge and information transfer appears to be relevant if we take into consideration that such type of communication and knowledge transfer has to take into consideration the difficulties and issues of trust between the two social parties (superiors and subordinates)  (Jirjhan and Pfeifer, 2009; Bramucci and Zanfei, 2015). 


	The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In the first chapter we will further explore the main divergencies in the literature regarding knowledge transfer and  network structural characteristics. After that, we will focus our attention on the studies regarding Simmelian ties and, in particular, on Simmelian ties belonging to diverse knowledge cliques (Tortoriello et al., 2015). In due course, we will review some contagion models and, evenetually, propose our model and provide a detailed description of the methodology followed in order to test it and to evaluate it.
	Finally, some considerations and implications for future research are drawn.

	\section{Literature Review}
	
	
	
	When it comes to study the role of networks in the transfer of knowledge and information, there are some specific aspects regarding the characteristics of the overall network that are considered to facilitate or hinder the transfer of knowledge.
	Sparse networks are considered to be reaching areas possessing diverse knowledge (Rowley et al., 2000) and to be  facing less constraints caused by the “prevailing cognitive scheme” (Wang et al., 2014 p.486) when it comes to explore new knowledge. On the contrary, dense networks promote trust and cooperation among its members (Coleman, 1988) due to reputation effects (Kreps, 1990).
	The studies that focus on the Ego subject, either analyze her personal qualities or her position within the network. Haas (2015) has pointed the presence of three “types” of individuals that appear to be particularly relevant when it comes to knowledge transfer: knowledge brokers, gate-keepers and boundary spanners. Brokers are considered to be subjects that find themselves to be bridging to otherwise disconnected groups of people and that can, thus, exploit the advantage caused by such condition (Burt 1992; 2007). On the other side, the advantage that gate-keepers enjoy is in relation with the company or the organization they operate for (Haas, 2015). Gate-keepers are generally positioned at the borders of the network of the organization they belong to (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990) and their main duty is to translate knowledge in order to make it available and usable by the other subject of the organization. Gate keepers favor the combination of external knowledge with internal knowledge thanks to their ability to understand and translate such type of knowledge (Morrison, 2008).
	Finally, boundary spanners (Tushman, 1977) are those subjects that are “capable of translating contrasting coding schemes […] between the work unit and external information areas” (p. 591). Friedman and Podolny (1992), provide an even broader definition, talking about a “central role in intergroup relations” (p. 28).
	It is relevant to notice how all the typologies described above share two characteristics, i.e., the ability of the focal subject to translate knowledge (Burt et al., 2013) and the fact that at least on of their connections crosses the border between one or more groups (Haas, 2015). It is, therefore, the position of the link connecting the “internal” with the “external” that stands out and that assumes considerable importance. However, the mere presence of a connection between two generic persons does not guarantee the transfer of knowledge and information; there are, in fact, different types of ties connecting two subjects.
	As a matter of fact, when it comes to knowledge transfer, tie strength is one of the characteristics that is generally studied (Gargiulo et al., 2009; Friedkin, 1982; Hansen, 1999). In the literature, ties’ strength is considered as “the (probably linear) combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy (mutual confiding), and the reciprocal services which characterize the tie” (Granovetter, 1973: p. 1361). The two typologies of tie (strong or weak) are better suited for the transfer of two different sets of knowledge; strong ties are better suited for the transfer of uncodified (Morrison, 2008; Reagans and McEvily, 2003), implicit (Fritsch and Kauffeld-Monz, 2010) and non-diversified knowledge (Gargiulo, 2009) while weak ties enable the acquisition and the transfer of diversified (Rodan and Galunic, 2004) and codified knowledge (Huggins and Thompson, 2014). However, such distinction is not categorical. In fact, strong ties can also be used to transfer codified knowledge (Reagans and McEvily, 2003) even though it might be costly (Hansen, 2002). 
	As discussed earlier, part of knowledge brokers’ advantage depends on the diversity of the knowledge that circulates in the groups that she connects (Burt, 1992; 2007). One aspect that should be considered is the accessibility of such sets of knowledge. More precisely, the clustering and cohesiveness of one group represents and obstacle for knowledge transfer between workers from different units (Krackhardt and Stern, 1988). The more two units are separated, the more distant and untranslatable the knowledge possessed by each unit is (Lissoni, 2001; Morrison, 2008), also for a potential broker (see Burt, 2015). 
	
	Cliques are subgroups of a network that are composed by members that are all connected to each other (Solorzano et al., 2019). 
	There’s a relevant branch of the research that focuses on cliques composed by three subjects, i.e., triads (Krackhardt, 1999; Kilduff and Lee, 2020).
	Triads are particularly interesting due to the psycho-social dynamics that come into play and that affect each relationship. As a matter of fact, such type of relationships are called “Simmelian ties” (Simmel, 1950; see Krackhardt, 1992). A Simmelian tie is a tie between two subjects who have a third relationship in common, i.e. a Simmelian tie is a tie within a triad (Krackhardt, 1992).
	There are three main aspects that differentiate Simmelian ties from other dyads (Solorzano et al., 2019).
	The first group of elements regards the reciprocity, the symmetry and the clearance that characterize the triad (Simmel, 1950); all subjects in the triad know each other and everyone is aware of it (Krackhardt, 1992). 
	Secondly, since everyone knows each other, when two subjects are interacting, the third party behaves as an indirect controlling dispositive (Krackhardt, 1998). Better put, the third party acts as a counterbalance to potential power imbalances, even though she doesn’t actively intervene (Solorzano et al., 2019; Krackhardt, 1999). In other words, subjects in a triad - that are, thus, connected through Simmelian ties - do not have the same bargaining power that they would have in a simple dyad (Krackhardt, 1998). Solorzano et al. (2019) argued that triads best express the necessary social normative power that prevents one of the subjects to behave in an “unregulated” way.
	Finally, the presence of a third subject permits the triad to be more unsusceptible to external influence (Solorzano et al. 2019). Strictly linked to the ones before, this characteristic prevents single subjects to be influenced by external subjects as it would result in a misconduct (depending on the rules of the triad under discussion).
	By increasing the stability of the relationships within the triads, favor the development of a “common language and shared understanding among the parties involved” (Tortoriello and Krackhardt, 2010: 168). Additionally, if a triad or a clique is composed by members that are distant (not only spatially), the relationships between such members allow the transfer of diverse knowledge (Tortoriello and Krackhardt, 2010) and are positively correlated with innovative productivity (Solorzano et al. 2019). Such positive correlation is caused by on the one hand, the strength of the tie that links two person that are part of the same clique or triad and, on the other hand, the distance between them. Structural arrangements having these characteristics have been defined by Tortoriello and colleagues (2015) as “diverse knowledge cliques”. 
	
	\subsection{Inter-unit Simmelian ties}
	Earlier in the paper we briefly mentioned the role that strong or weak ties play in the transfer of knowledge with a particular emphasis regarding the characteristic of the different types of knowledge that strong or weak ties can better transfer. One of the main issues that subjects might face when trying to transfer or absorb knowledge coming from distant subjects in the network is the fact that it can be uncodified and, thus, hard to translate, replicate or absorb (Chen et al. 2014). 
	Tortoriello and Krackhardt (2010) wanted to see whether Simmelian ties – by virtue of their assumed strength – could not just facilitate the transfer of tacit, complex and uncodified knowledge but whether, in case they connected subjects situated in different working units of a company, they could facilitate the transfer of distant and diverse knowledge. 
	As a matter of fact, Tortoriello and Krackhardt (2010) take into consideration two types of networks representing the same group: the formal network (formal organization of the company) and the informal network (Krackhardt and Hanson, 1993). Taking into consideration both structures enriches the comprehension of the dynamics that come into play in the knowledge transfer process. 
	Nevertheless, Tortoriello and Krackhardt’s (2010) research is limited to inter-unit analysis and, thus, acknowledges the potential discrepancies that might exist between the formal and the informal structure of a company without taking into consideration the broader social aspects to which such discrepancies might be linked in a causational way. 
	We propose to consider the distance within subjects in the network. In particular, one aspect that we consider relevant to analyze would be the role that Simmelian ties might play in the vertical transfer of knowledge within a company, which is the transfer of knowledge between two subjects that belong to different hierarchical levels in the organizational structure. More specifically, we want to understand whether the presence of Simmelian ties between subjects that occupy vertically differentiated position within a company facilitate the transfer of knowledge between such subjects.
	
	In this paper we want to propose and test different models have been derived from the Bass model (Goldenberg et al. 2002), the DeGroot model (Assenova, 2018) and from other contagion models (Melnik et al,. 2013; Iacopini et al., 2019). The aim is twofold. On the one hand we intend to understand how Vertically spanning simmelian ties might facilitate or hinder the transfer of information throughout a network and, on the other hand, to consequently further the discussion regarding the modelling of information transfer within a network.
	In the following sections we will provide a description of the way in which we built our model.

	
	\subsection{Diffusion models}
	We earlier explored the literature that tried to understand the impact that different structural characteristics have on the diffusion of knowledge within a group. At the same time, however, we can try to understand such process by simplifying the knowledge transfer process by considering the transfer of information as the simplified version of the knowledge transfer process (Yale and Gilly, 1995; Antonelli, 1996). Studying how information is transferred simplifies the modelling process of the transfer of knowledge. Different streams of literature have, in fact, modelled the transfer of information in order to model and explain different phenomena. For instance, on of the most important stream of research is the one that tries to understand how an idea or an information is transferred throughout a group given specific structural characteristics (Assenova, 2018). There are two main categories of diffusion models and the main differences regard the baseline assumption and the applicability of the model. As a matter of fact, the first category, that is represented by aggregated models, assumes the homogeneity of the analyzed population (Tanny and Derzko, 1988) and generally proposes models that are derived from the Bass model. The Bass model was initially developed to study the adoption rate of a generic innovation by consumers. As we will see more in details, the models derived by the Bass ones also assume that the each subject within the population have two sources of information. The first one is external and is composed by mass media and advertisement; the second one is considered the internal one and represents the interpersonal communication between the subjects within the population (Bohlman et al. 2010). Generally, the first one is considered to be less relevant but necessary for the second one (Goldenberg et al. 2002). The advantage of such model lies on the fact that it is easy applicable also to considerably large populations (Bohlman et al. 2010) even though it might be excessively simplistic and inaccurate (Chatterjee and Eliashberg, 1990). 
	Another group of diffusion models is composed by those studies that tried to take into consideration the heterogeneity of the subjects and of their relations with other subjects within the population. Researches in this field have proposed agent based models (ABM) that were able to take into account microlevel peculiarities (Kiesling et al., 2011). On the one hand, AB models allow the relaxation of some aggregation examples; on the other hand, they entail worthwhile costs at the computational level (Rahmandad and Sterman, 2008). Within this group, researches have proposed models that were derived from contagion models (Pastor-Satorras et al. 2015; Strang and Soule, 1998) but also DeGroot models (Assenova, 2018).
	Each of the above-mentioned models has its own advantages and drawbacks and is, reasonably, more or less suitable depending on the focus of this paper. Having this been said, in this paper we want to explore each of the main models here listed and try to understand which one is better suited for our own research question.
	The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. in the following section, we will explore each of the models and try to tailor them according to our object of analysis. For each model, simulations and sensitivity analyses will be carried out and, finally, a discussion will expose the main characteristics of the models proposed.

	\subsection{The Bass Model}
	Earlier we discussed about aggregate models and pointed to the Bass model as the founding and most relevant one. Even though the model has different drawbacks in terms of predictive capability (Van den Bulte and Lilien, 1997), the model has been used and adapted without particular changes to its main characteristics (Mahajan et al., 1990).
	The Bass model models the diffusion of an information, an idea or an innovation through two main sources of influence: one external, such as advertisement, and one internal, represented by the word of mouth and the interpersonal relationships. For instance, it is relevant to notice that the firs factor does not depend on the amount or ratio of previous adopters as does the second source (Goldenberg et al., 2000). Therefore, the probability of an individual - that has not been "infected" - at time $t$ to be "infected" or to adopt a new innovation described as follows:
	
	\begin{equation} \label{bass}
		\dfrac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}=p+qF(t)
	\end{equation}
	
	where $f(t)$ is the probability of adoption at time $t$, $F(t)$ is the cumulative distribution function of adoptions at time $t$, $p$ is a parameter indicating external influence and, finally, $q$ indicates the number of previous adopters, $i.e.$ the internal influence.
	We earlier said that models inspired by the Bass model assume that the population is homogeneous. However, there are some researches that tried to take into account the potential heterogeneity of the population under analysis. Van den Bulte and Stremersch (2004) have, for example, tried to consider different national cultures - defined through Hofstede's (2001) dimensions -  and different income levels and their relationship with a $\dfrac{q}{p}$ ratio. Other studies have, also, tried to consider a segmented population (Goldenberg et al., 2002).
	Nevertheless, these streams have focused on the willingness of a subject to be "infected" or to adopt - and consequently to spread. In this paper, however, our claim is that specific structural characteristics (vertically spanning Simmelian ties) should favor the spread and transfer of information throughout a group. An interesting solution has been proposed by Sinha and Chandrashekaran (1992) who have proposed a "split" version of the bass model dividing the population in two parts: the one who will never adopt and the ones who are still willing to adopt. As we can see, the homogeneity assumption has been dropped even though some degree of simplification is still guaranteed. We, therefore, should focus on the interpersonal source of influence and, considering the fact that we're adopting an aggregate approach, should focus on an index that is able to tell us the distribution of vertically spanning simmelian ties within a group. Similarly to what Melnik and colleagues (2013) have suggested, we have to consider that we have two populations each of which has a higher or lower capability to spread a message; as the authors suggest, the two groups - normal spreaders and high spreaders - are not two separate groups, but the former is a subgroup of the other. therefore, taking as example the Bass model and the work of Melnik et al. (2013), we suggest:
	\begin{equation} \label{eqn}
		\dfrac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}=p+(q_n+\varphi{q_s})F(t)
	\end{equation}
	where, as before $f(t)$ is the probability of adoption at time $t$, $F(t)$ is the cumulative distribution function of adoptions at time $t$, $p$ is a parameter indicating external influence and, finally, $q_n$ indicates the number of previous adopters that are normal spreaders and $q_s$ the number of previous adopters that are strong spreaders. Together, they form what in \eqref{bass} was $q$, $i.e.$ the internal influence. In substance, we divided the adopters in two groups. For the second group $q_s$, however, we addeda parameter $\varphi$ with the aim of adding a weight to the number of "high spreaders". The idea behind such modification is that subjects that are high spreader should have an higher weight when compared with the ones that are considered "normal spreader". Getting back to the focus of this paper, $q_s$ are those subjects that are connected through, at least, one Simmelian tie. But what about the weight $\varphi$? Considering that we're taking into consideration the overall structure and that, supposedly, a company with more vertical simmelian ties should be faster in the transmission of an information, we should find an index that can indicate the quantity of vertically spanning simmelian ties but also how "vertical" they are.
	
	The key idea is that by including also the share of population that are connected through specific ties (here Simmelian ones) we can discern the role that a higher or lower share of these play in the transfer o information throughout a group.
	In this case, however, we need to find an index that is able not only to portray the distribution of vertically spanning simmelian ties, but also whether they're connecting hierarchically distant or closer subjects. 
	
	Similarly to Tortoriello and Krackhardt (2010), we propose to consider the role of Vertically spanning triads in the transfer of information within an organization. In order to do so, we will utilize the information obtained from two networks:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The formal network, which represents the structural organization of a company, \emph{i.e.} the hierarchical relationships between superiors and subordinates. Such network is represented by an undirected tree-like graph (Hunter, 2016);
		\item The informal network, which represents the personal relationship between employees of a company. In this paper we represent such network by utilising different random network generation models (see \emph{infra}).
	\end{itemize}
	
	Let $G(N,R^*)$ be the informal network composed by $N$ members and $R^\ast$ ties and let $F(N,E)$ be the formal network composed by $N$ members and $E$ ties.

	\bigskip
	Previous researchers have pointed out several aspects that must be considered when it comes to friendship networks as people tend to simplify and bias their relationship in order to achieve a sort of “cognitive simplicity” (Kilduff and Lee, 2020). On the one hand, people tend to perceive their relationships as “balanced", meaning that they prefer to find reciprocity even when there’s none (Heider, 1958). On the other hand, there’s a tendency for the recreation of a “small world” when there is a cognitive fallacy, meaning that in case of lacking information regarding the relationship within a given group, the members of such group will tend to consider the network as more connected than it actually is (Kilduff et al. 2008).
	In order to tackle this issue, we will take into consideration what Krackhardt (1992) has termed as “Actual Networks”. Actual Networks are indirect networks in which an edge between two subject exists only if both of them declare its existence. Better put, an edge between i and j exists if:
	
	\begin{equation} \label{eqn1}
		R_{i,j}^* = \begin{cases} 1 & \mbox{if } R_{i,j}^i=R_{i,j}^j=1 \\ 0 & \mbox{otherwise}  \end{cases}
	\end{equation}
	
	Where $R_{i,j}^i$ is the acknowledgement of the existence of the edge $R_{i,j}$ by $i$ and $R_{i,j}^j$ is the acknowledgement of the existence of the edge $R_{i,j}$ by $j$. Only if both subjects declare the existence of such tie we will have the “actual” tie $R_{i,j}^\ast$.
	Having defined the basic unit of analysis that we want to consider, we must now define an additional element that is crucial for the analysis that this paper aims to carry on, i.e. Simmelian Ties. There are different ways to individuate Simmelian ties. We will follow the methodology proposed by Krackhardt (1998). According to the author, a generic tie, $R_{i,j}^\ast$, is a Simmelian tie if the following conditions are satisfied: 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\begin{aligned}[t]
			R_{i,j}^\ast=R_{j,i}^*=1\
		\end{aligned}$
		\item $\begin{aligned}[t]
			R_{i,k}^\ast{=R}_{k,i}^\ast{=R}_{j,k}^\ast{=R}_{k,j}^\ast=1 
		\end{aligned}$
	\end{enumerate}
	The first condition expresses the necessity for symmetry between the two subjects connected by the tie. The second condition, on the other hand, expresses the necessity of the tie to be situated in a triad, the members of which are connected through actual ties.
	
	Eventualy we will obtain:
	
	\begin{equation} \label{eqn}
		t_k= \begin{cases} 1 & \exists~k \mid R_{m,n}^*=R_{m,k}^*=R_{n,k}^*=1 \\ 0 & \mbox{otherwise}  \end{cases}
	\end{equation}
	
	where $t_k$ is the \emph{k}th triad in $G$ within the interval  [$1,2\dots k\dots K$]\footnote{
		
		Where
		$\begin{aligned}
			t_k \in \{t_1, t_2\dots t_k, \dots, t_ K\}
		\end{aligned}$
	}.
	
	Having defined the unit of analysis and the way in which we’re going to individuate it, it is now time to discuss the way in which we are going to characterize a vertical Simmelian tie. 
	We will measure the verticality of a tie utilizing information of the structure of the formal network $F$ but we will refer to connections $R^*$ formed in the informal network $G$.  In order to do so, we will individuate all the triads $G$ (see \emph{Figure} 1) of a company. After having done that, we will project these triads on the formal network of the same company (see \emph{Figures} 2 and 3).
	
	
	Before individuating the verticality of a Simmelian tie, we need to measure the hierarchy of each subject $i^\prime$ in the formal network. In order to do so, we will follow Freeman’s (1977) suggestion. For instance, the author considered the measurement of Betweenness Centrality as a good indicator for measuring the hierarchical level of a worker within the company if we assume that the organizational structure of a company resembles a tree network (Hunter, 2016) (see \emph{Figure 3}).
	
	\begin{equation}
		{C_{i^\prime}}=\frac{2}{n^2-3n+2}\sum_{k^\prime,n^\prime\neq i^\prime}\frac{{\ b}_{k^\prime n^\prime }^{i^\prime}}{b_{k^\prime n^\prime}}
	\end{equation}
	
	
	In which ${\ b}_{k^\prime n^\prime }^{i^\prime}$ indicates the number of geodesic paths (shortest path between two nodes) between the nodes $k^\prime$ and $n^\prime$ (that are different from m) that pass through the node $i^\prime$, while ${b_{k^\prime n^\prime}}$ indicates the number of geodesic paths between $k^\prime$ and $n^\prime$. $\frac{2}{n^2-3n+2}$ is a normalization factor (Freeman, 1977).
	It is now time to tackle the issue of Verticality within a triad. In order to do so, we will calculate the variance of the measurement $C_m$ measured on the formal network for each node in a triad formed in the informal network $t_k$.
	
	\begin{equation}
		{V}_{t_k}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^3\left({C_i}-{\overline{C}}_k\right)^2}{n_t}
	\end{equation}
	
	
	Where ${C_i}$ is the betweenness centrality of a node in the formal network while $\overline{C}$ is the average of the betweenness centrality of the nodes (of the triad) in the formal network. Ultimately, $n_t$ indicates the amount of nodes considered in the calculations of the variance. Nevertheless, as long as we’re taking into consideration only triads, $n_t$ will always be equal to 3. Let us recall that we will need to take into consideration the verticality of all the potential triads within the network.
	In substance, $\nu$ indicates the average variance  of the betweenness centrality calculated on the formal structure but within triads that have previously been individuated in the informal structure.
	\begin{equation}
		\nu=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\frac{{V}_{t_k}}{K}
	\end{equation}
	Where $V_{t_k}$ is the variance of \emph{Betweenness Centrality} (calculated as in Formula 4) in the formal network of triads individuated in the informal network ($t_i$, defined as in \emph{Formula 7}). 
	As we argued earlier, following Freeman (1977), we utilize betweenness centrality as a proxy of hierarchy. $\nu$, therefore, indicates the average variance of hierarchy within informal triads in a population, i.e. the variance of Hierarchy 
	The higher $\nu$ is, the higher the degree of Verticality of the Simmellian ties within a given network.
	
	In order to make sure that the measurement of the distribution of vertical simmelian ties within a company is not affected by other factors such as the amount $N$ of subject in the organization or other peculiar aspects, we propose to normalize our $\nu$ with a measurement that takes into consideration all the possible triads within a network. Such value is calculated as:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\rho=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T}V_{t_T}}{T}
	\end{equation}
	
	Where ${V}_{t_T}$ represents the variance within a generic triad and $T$ is the total amount of possible triads in a given network.
	$\rho$ indicates the average $V$ of all the potential triads. Such value is entirely detached from the parameters of the informal network. The value of $\rho$, by being the average $V$ of all the potential triads, is the $\nu$ representing all the potential triads. At the same time, however, getting back to the probabilistic game approach, $\rho$ represents the expected value that we would obtain if we draw a “card” or a set of “cards”. $\rho$, therefore, indicates the value of $\nu$ that a group should have, given its formal network. $\rho$, thus, represents an independent characteristic of the formal network of a company or organization. 
	
	By comparing $\nu$ with $\rho$, we acknowledge whether our sample can be considered as more  or less vertically connected given the formal network that it is associated with. More clearly, when compared with $\nu$, it allows to account for diverse structural characteristics that might . 
	More clearly, be $\varphi$ calculated as follows:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\varphi=\frac{\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{K}V_{t_K}}{K}}{\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T}V_{t_T}}{T}}
	\end{equation}
	
	In a more simplified way:
	\begin{equation}
		\varphi=\frac{\nu}{\rho}
	\end{equation}
	
	$\varphi$ indicates the comparison of the \emph{actual verticality} of all the  Simmelian ties of the informal network compared to the \emph{expected verticality} of all the possible combinations Simmelian ties. If $\varphi$ is higher than 1, it means that the informal network we have in front of us is more vertically spanning than a hypothetical (or randomly generated) network could be. If, on the other hand, $\varphi$ is lower than 1, it means that the informal network we have in front of us is less vertically spanning than a hypothetical (or randomly generated network could be). 
	
	
	\subsection{The DeGroot Model}
	In the previous chapter we explored the Bass model and a potential adaptation for its application for our research question. However, regardless such adaptation, we still lack a precise description of the dynamics that come into play and that drive the transfer of information. 
	We earlier mentioned the utilization of the DeGroot model for predicting the diffusion of innovations (Assenova, 2018). However, it is relevant to mention that the DeGroot model has been initially developed with the aim of studying how a the opinion of subjects within an organization changes depending on their starting opinion, the opinion of the others and the relationship we have with the others.
	For instance, let us consider the same sample as before, represented by the two networks Let $G(N,R^*)$ the informal one and  $F(N,E)$, the formal one. Let us now assume that such group have diverse opinions regarding a specific topic represented by a vector of probabilities $p(0)=(p_0(0),...p_n(0),...p_N(0))$. Each generic $p_i(0)$ lies within the interval [0,1] (see DeGroot, 1974). Differently from before, the opinion of each subject depends on the interaction with her direct connections and not on the distribution of the opinion on the overall sample. For instance, if there is no tie between \textit{i} and \textit{j}, \textit{i} neither of the two will affect the other. However, the novelty proposed by DeGroot consists in weighting the capability of person \textit{j} to influence person \textit{i} or the trust that subject \textit{i} places on the belief of subject \textit{j}. The matrix {\bf{T}}, represents the overall set of "trust" ties within the sample. 
	
	The beliefs of the sample are updated at each time period so that:
	\begin{equation}
		p(t)={\bf{T}}p(t-1)
	\end{equation}
	and for single subjects:
	\begin{equation}
		p_i(t)=\sum_{j=1}^{N}T_{i,j}p_j(t-1)
	\end{equation}
	where $T_{i,j}$ represents the trust that \textit{i} places on all her \textit{j}th's belief, $j(t-1)$ is \textit{j}th's belief at time $t-1$.
	Now, after having briefly discussed the main relevant characteristics of the DeGroot model, we must discuss the way in which we should adapt it in order to utilize it for answering our research question.
	For instance, trust is not only relevant for opinion dynamics, but also for the transfer of knowledge (Tsai and Goshal, 1998; Rutten et al., 2016). Also, some studies have highlighted the importance of trust and perceived leadership in the active search for information (Yale and Gilly, 1995, see also Khvatova et al., 2016).
	
	More recently, Assenova (2018) has tried to model the diffusion of innovation by adapting the DeGroot model. For instance, instead of expressing a generic opinion, in the model of Assenova $p_i(\nu)$ indicates the value that subject \textit{i} attributes to the good $\nu$. As it happens with the DeGroot model, the value that a person attributes to the good $\nu$ is updated at each time step and depends on the value that her neighbors attribute to the good $\nu$. The value that subject \textit{i} attributes to the good $\nu$ at time \textit{t} is:
	\begin{equation}
		p^t_i(\nu)=\sum_{j=1}^{N}T_{i,j}p^{(t-1)}_j(\nu)
	\end{equation}
	where $T_{i,j}$ represents the trust that \textit{i} places on all her \textit{j}th's belief, $p^{(t-1)}_j(\nu)$ is the value that the \textit{j}th's attributes to the good $\nu$. However, it is relevant to notice that being influenced by her neighbor do not automatically the subject to adopt. The author, in fact, poses as a condition that:
	\begin{equation}
		p^t_i(\nu)\geq\nu_i
	\end{equation}
	where $\nu_i$ is her threshold of adoption. 
	
	Differently from the basic Bass model that we described earlier, the model that Assenova proposes accepts the possibility that subject stops to adopt an innovation if the value that she attributes to the good reaches a level below her adoption level due to interaction with her neighbors. 
	
	Having this been said, we now want to suggest few modifications in order to adapt it to our own case. As long as the DeGroot model is an agent based model, we must put aside the index developed on the previous section and try to find a different way to include the role that vertical Simmelian ties play in the diffusion of information throughout an organization from a network perspective. 
	
	First of all, we will consider perception of the relevance of a given information $p_i$ as the value that the subject attributes to such information. 
	
	Secondly, instead of considering adoption, we will consider the transformation from a passive actor to an active one, \textit{i.e.}, after having achieved a given threshold $\nu_i$.
	
	Eventually, one of our assumptions was that subjects from different hierarchical level could are less prone to interact and to trust each other's belief (see Khmatova et al., 2016; Rutten et al., 2016). We, therefore, will still keep using the Trust matrix proposed by DeGroot and its characteristics (see DeGroot 1974). In order to do so, we will simply adapt the {\bf{T}} matrix making sure that the trust relationship between two subjects belonging to two different hierarchical positions byXXXXXspiegare che usiamo probabilitàdiverse
	On the other side, however, we should take into consideration that the assumption that having a relationship with someone, does not automatically imply that at time \textit{t} that person will communicate with us and that it will communicate a given information. Considering that sharing information can be considered as information episodes (Yale and Gilly, 1995) and that interactions with people connected through a Simmelian tie temd to have more frequent interactions (Krackhardt, 1999). We, therefore, need to include one to the DeGroot model as revised by Assenova (2018), \textit{i.e.}, a matrix {\bf{B(t)}} that represents the collective whether two persons will interact at the generic time step \textit{t} depending on specific probabilities.
	
	For instance, considering the mentioned modification, each subject \textit{i} will update her perception regarding the relevance of an information according to:
	\begin{equation}\label{ourDeGroot}
		p_i(t)=\sum_{j=1}^{N}T_{i,j}B_{i,j}(t)p_j(t-1)
	\end{equation}
	where $B_{i,j}(t-1)$ expresses whether the subjects \textit{i} and \textit{j} have interacted at the time step $t-1$, $T_{i,j}$ represents the trust that subject \textit{i} places on \textit{j}'s beliefs and, eventually, $p_j(t-1)$ is the relevance of the information for subject $j$ at time $t-1$.
	
	Before proceeding, it is relevant to stress few implications of the new aspects that have been included.
	First of all, differently Assenova (2018), if $p_j(t-1)$ is below $j$'s threshold, it's value is equal to $0$. More precisely:
	\begin{equation} \label{condition1}
		p_j(t)= \begin{dcases}
			p_j(t) & \text{if } p_j(t)\geq \nu_j \\0 & \text{otherwise}
		\end{dcases}	
	\end{equation}
	where $p_j(t)$ is the perception of the relevance of the information at any generic time $t$ and $\nu_j$ is the threshold necessary for $j$ to start spreading the information. If the $j$th subject is not convinced that the information is sufficiently relevant, \textit{i.e.}  is not above her threshold, she will not share her opinion with $i$. 
	
	This condition has several implications. The first one is that it includes in the model the whether the \textit{alter} considers the information sufficiently relevant in order to share it. The second implication regards the fact that subject $i$'s perception regarding the information is not affected by $j$'s perception if $j$ is not sharing the information. 
	
	Additionally, we wanted to introduce a Bernoulli variable $B_{i,j}$ which indicates whether $i$ receives the information from $j$ and assumes the following values:
	\begin{equation} \label{condition2}
		B= \begin{dcases}
			1 & \text{with probability } \xi \\0 & \text{with probability} \ 1-\xi
		\end{dcases}	
	\end{equation}
	where $\xi$ is a probability. By including this variable, we are taking into consideration the fact that $i$ and $j$ are connected doesn't mean that they're always communicating and that, in particular, the first will receive the information by the second.
	It is important to stress that, due to the way in which we designed our model, subject $i$ can be informed by her $j$th neighbor if and only if both conditions expressed in \eqref{condition1} and in \eqref{condition2} are true; if one of the two conditions is not satisfied, \textit{i.e.} $p_j(t)$ or $B$ is equal to $0$, subject $i$ does not receive the information by her $j$th neighbor. Eventually, this means that subject $i$ updates her perception regarding the information taking into consideration those neighbours that are convinced and that, at the same time, happen to interact with her. 
	Setting these conditions allows us to discern different groups within an hypothetical sample, \textit{i.e.} the subjects connected through a Simmelian tie and the ones that are connected through a normal tie. Additionally, we can distinguish between transfer of information that go "upward", \textit{i.e.} when a subordinate shares an information with her superior and \textit{viceversa}. We will be able to assign different probabilities to each possible combination with the aim of highlighting the role that Simmelian ties could potentially play. This will be further explained in the next chapter as we will use them also for the contagion model.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	\subsection{Contagion Models}
	In the previous sections we've briefly explored two typologies of models that have been used to study the diffusion (adoption) of an innovation by a given population. After that, we proposed a couple of modification with the aim of making the models able to take into consideration the specific structural characteristic that is under discussion. 
	
	For instance, it is relevant to notice that, due to its homogeneity is unable to take into account the structural characteristics of the network of the sample that it is analysing (seeXXXX). Even if in the literature are present several researches that tried to segment the population under analysis (Sinha and Chandrashekaran,1992), at the best of our knowledge, a more fine-grained subdivision has not been done yet. By adding $\varphi$ in our model, we attempt to account for particular structural characteristics, even though we're still segmenting our sample, we have nevertheless introduced an element that accounts for the structure behind the sample.
	
	Aware of the limitations linked with the Bass model for the analysis that we propose to carry out, we decided to explore another model that is able to consider the structure of the network of a group and that, according to the findings of Assenova (2018), can be used to model the adoption of a given technology. Eventually, instead of considering the opinion of the subjects as the willingness to adopt, we treated it as the perception of the relevance of an information. However, differently from Assenova (2018), we do not allow to every subject to influence the opinion of the others. More similarly to contagion models (see Melnik et al., 2013; Iacopini et al., 2019), we consider only people that achieved a specific threshold to be actively able to influence other people. This is because knowing something is not sufficient in order to influence the others; there must be an active interaction between the two subjects (sender and receiver) and the sender has to decide what to send (see Yale and Gilly, 1995). We, therefore, not only consider the relational structure behind a population, but also the fact that influence \textit{à la} DeGroot regarding the perception of an information can happen only if there is an "information episode" (Yale and Gilly, 1995 p.225), \textit{i.e.} when the source sends an information to the receiver.
	
	Having this been said, we are of the opinion that also the DeGroot model, as modified in \eqref{ourDeGroot}, might have some drawbacks when it comes to modeling the diffusion of an information throughout a network. For instance, the DeGroot model allows people to influence people to change opinion, also to returning to the initial one, the same applies for the model suggested by Assenova. On the contrary, one person can not convince another person that an information is not relevant without informing the receiver. It is the receiver that decides how important the opinion of the source is (Yale and Gilly, 1995) and, at the same time, information sharing processes are characterized by a cumulative process (Bao et al., 2013; see Centola and Macy; 2007). At the same time, however, we have to take into consideration that an information will not circulate endlessly and that it will eventually dissipate XXXXref. However, such dissipation should not be dependent on the perception of the relevance of others but on other factors, such as time (refXXXX) or other structural characteristics (Iacopini et al. 2019)
	Our suggestion is, therefore, focus once more on contagion models similar to the ones proposed by Iacopini and colleagues (2019) but also by Karsai et al. (2014). Differently from Karsai et al. (2014), however, we're not taking into consideration the presence of external influence (\textit{e.g.} mass media, advertisement etc.). 
	Developing something that behave similarly to \eqref{ourDeGroot}, we propose:
	
	\begin{equation} \label{ourcontagion}
		p_i(t)={p_i(t-1)+1/N\sum_{i\neq j}^{N}T_{i,j}p_j(t-1)B_{i,j}(t)} 
		\end{equation}
	
	where $p_i(t)$, as before, is the perception that subject $i$ has regarding the information at a generic time step $t$, $T_{i,j}$ is the trust that $i$ places on $j$'s opinion, $p_j(t-1)$ is the perception that subject $j$ has regarding the information at $t-1$ and $B_i,j(t-1)$ express whether the subjects \textit{i} and \textit{j} have interacted at the time step $t-1$ and assumes the same values as in \eqref{condition2}. As before, conditions stated in \eqref{condition1} and in {condition2} apply and, therefore, also in this case subject $i$ is influenced by its $j$th neighbour if $j$ is sufficiently convinced \eqref{condition1} and if there is an interaction between the two subjects \eqref{condition2}. 
	
	However, there's a difference with the DeGroot Model that regards the trust that each subject places on the beliefs of her neighbours. For instance, in the DeGroot model, the sum of all weights (included the trust that the subject $i$ places on her own opinion, $s_{i,i}$) can not exceed 1. On the contrary, in \eqref{ourcontagion} we do not consider the trust that the subject $i$ places on her own opinion in such condition. In fact, we set that:
	\begin{equation}\label{condition3}
	\sum_{i\neq j}^{N}T_{i.j}=1
	\end{equation}
	
As a matter of fact, if subject $i$ is not influenced by anyone at any generic time step $t$, she will keep the same perception regarding the relevance of the information under discussion. 

However, left as it is, \eqref{ourcontagion} implies that, eventually, every subject in the sample will be aware of the information and also willing to share it. At the same time, however, we know that as time passes, the relevance of an information decreases for people. We, therefore, should also take into consideration a recovery process that might depend on time (Fan et al., 2020), which can be done by adding a deadening factor $\beta$, which can acquire a value between 0 and 1:

	\begin{equation} \label{ourcontagion}
		p_i(t)=-\beta+{p_i(t-1)+1/N\sum_{i\neq j}^{N}T_{i,j}p_j(t-1)B_{i,j}(t)} 
		\end{equation}
